 * @brief Partition Entry struct.
 *
 * Master Boot Record (MBR):</b>
 * Located at offset 0x1BE in the 1st sector of a disk, MBR 
 * contains four 16-byte partition entries. Should end with
 * 55h & AAh.
 *
 * Partition in MBR:
 * A PC hard disk can contain either as many as four primary
 * partitions, or 1-3 primaries and a single extended partition.
 * Each of these partitions are described by a 16-byte entry in
 * the Partition Table which is located in the Master Boot Record.
 *
 * extended partition:
 * It is essentially a link list with many tricks. See at
 * - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_boot_record for details.
